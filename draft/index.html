          <h2>Names & Genres</h2>
          <p>
            The frequency of the name's occurrence depends on movie genre as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of comedies with main characters called <span class="female">Candy</span>, <span class="female">Tiffany</span>, <span class="male">Randy</span> or <span class="male">Chip</span>. But it can be a bit tricky to find a commedy about <span class="male">Elias</span> or <span class="female">Marian<span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, <span class="female">Anna</span>, <span class="female">Teresa</span> and <span class="female">Cecilia</span> are without doubt Drama Queens and <span class="male">Bruce</span>,<span class="male">Wong</span> and <span class="male">Duke</span> are mainly adventure guys.
          </p>
          <p><small>Yes, there are obviously more male characters in adventure/action movies & tv series and more female characters in dramas.</small></p>
