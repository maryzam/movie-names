      <p>What can we learn by aggregating first names of characters from millions of movies and tv series (since 1890th years till our days)?</p>

          <h2>Cinema vs Real Life</h2>
          <p>Is your name more common in a daily life or in a movie?</p>
          <p>Let's compare the frequency of top 50 most popular US names according to information from social security card applications and their number of occurrences in the film industry.</p>
          <p>Almost all of the top 50 names in US are not so popular in movies & tv series. Everyone can easily remember several <b>Christophers, Donalds, Matthews, Patricias or Dorothies</b> from school, University or neighbourhood. But writers do not rush to call the main characters with such names. Seems that they just don't want to use too ordinary names in their scenarios.</p>
          <p>There are only three exceptions from this rule - <b>Frank, Paul and Sarah.</b> On the other hand, there is a bunch of "cinematic" names such as <b>Simon</b> (20 times more often in movies & tv than in real life), <b>Kate</b> (20 times more often) and <b>Charlie</b> (6 times more oftern).</p>

          <h2>Names & Genres</h2>
          <p>
            The frequency of the name's occurrence depends on movie genre as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of comedies with main characters called <span class="female">Candy</span>, <span class="female">Tiffany</span>, <span class="male">Randy</span> or <span class="male">Chip</span>. But it can be a bit tricky to find a comedy about <span class="male">Elias</span> or <span class="female">Marian<span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, <span class="female">Anna</span>, <span class="female">Teresa</span> and <span class="female">Cecilia</span> are without doubt Drama Queens and <span class="male">Bruce</span>,<span class="male">Wong</span> and <span class="male">Duke</span> are mainly adventure guys.
          </p>
          <p><small>Yes, there are obviously more male characters in adventure/action movies & tv series and more female characters in dramas.</small></p>
